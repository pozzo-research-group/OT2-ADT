    "### Step 4: Calculate Volumes of Stocks\n",
    "From the mass/volume of individual chemical components we calculauted along with the concentration and identities of the provided stocks, we are now able to combine those two pieces of information and obtain the volume of stock needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general function to use Create.calculate_stock_volumes_from_component_concs will autoamatically use the component information either volume or stock depending on the stock which contains the component and its stock unit. The stock unit essentially determines the pathway of whether component mass or volume will be utilized.See ______ for a map of how specific component concentration untis and stock units pair together to calculate for info. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This will calculate stock volumes not taking into account any interdepdencies such as common solvents or missing volume to complete a desired sample volume. The next step will have a few cases for which specfic functions can calculate and adjust stock volumes. "

For example if ethanol is present in 2 stocks and ethanol must be a specfic wtf then we must take into account the ethanol added when adding those two stocks. The case may arise where you do not specify the concentration of the common solvent and in that case we do not care about the final concentration of common solvent so no need to track for it. The function you would use is **Create.calculate_common_solvent_residual_volumes()**\n",

The function to use is **Create.complete_missing_volume_with_commmon_solvent()** which you can specify the name of a new stock along with the total completing volume and/or if not provided will automatically look for a single solvent stock and use that to fill.\n",
