For example if ethanol is present in 2 stocks and ethanol must be a specfic wtf then we must take into account the ethanol added when adding those two stocks. The case may arise where you do not specify the concentration of the common solvent and in that case we do not care about the final concentration of common solvent so no need to track for it.
