    "### Step 4: Calculate Volumes of Stocks\n",
    "From the mass/volume of individual chemical components we calculauted along with the concentration and identities of the provided stocks, we are now able to combine those two pieces of information and obtain the volume of stock needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general function to use Create.calculate_stock_volumes_from_component_concs will autoamatically use the component information either volume or stock depending on the stock which contains the component and its stock unit. The stock unit essentially determines the pathway of whether component mass or volume will be utilized.See ______ for a map of how specific component concentration untis and stock units pair together to calculate for info. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This will calculate stock volumes not taking into account any interdepdencies such as common solvents or missing volume to complete a desired sample volume. The next step will have a few cases for which specfic functions can calculate and adjust stock volumes. "
