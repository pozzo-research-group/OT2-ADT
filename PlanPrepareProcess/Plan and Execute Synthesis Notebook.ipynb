    "    * Reading directly as csv is fine but it requires you have correctly format strings. This forces you to put marks ('') around each string variable value when planning the experiment.

However you do not need to place it around numbers or other dtypes.\n",

    "    * Loading from excel can be done in a similar manner but is avoided due not having xlrd or openpyxl depdenency native to python, and the opentrons being limited in the packages we can add/update. Hence we default to a CSV.\n",
    "* The experiment dictionary consist of keys being the variable name and the value being the variables value. It is important to always keep in mind the order of every variable is linear and should be assumed to be match all other variables (i.e. Component Shorthand Names index 1 = Component Concentration index 1). This assumption is the default for any function using variables from the experiment dictionary, however we can deviate it from it if needed. \n",

    "    * *Common/Dependents Solvents Case:* When components are mixed in solvents for their stock that are part of other components stocks. This case requires you to not only remove the components of interest in the volume side of the dataframe, but if the removed component is part of a stock which contains a common solvent, that removed quantity must find itself back to the common solvent. The upside to this case is there is no need to update the composition/concentration poriton of the dataframe as \n",

This object will allow use to initialize all labware, instrumentation and commands to the OT2. \n",
