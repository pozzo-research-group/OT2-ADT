At the moment this step is done by opening a CSV file in Excel, where the first column is the name of the variable and the adjacent column is the variable value. The default delimitter is (,). \n",
    "    * Reading directly as csv is fine but it requires you have correctly format strings. This forces you to put marks ('') around each string variable value when planning the experiment. NOTE: You still need to place marks around anything inside a dtype i.e components inside a list [\"component 1\", component 2\"]. However you do not need to place it around numbers or other dtypes.\n",

    "    * Loading from excel can be done in a similar manner but is avoided due not having xlrd or openpyxl depdenency native to python, and the opentrons being limited in the packages we can add/update. Hence we default to a CSV.\n",
    "* The experiment dictionary consist of keys being the variable name and the value being the variables value. It is important to always keep in mind the order of every variable is linear and should be assumed to be match all other variables (i.e. Component Shorthand Names index 1 = Component Concentration index 1). This assumption is the default for any function using variables from the experiment dictionary, however we can deviate it from it if needed. \n",

    "# Step 8: Simulate/Execute\n",
    "* The main information needed to create commands for the OT2 is the position of the stocks and the volumes in respect to each well you would like to move the stock to. All volumes in sent to the OT2 will be interpretted as microliters (uL). \n",
    "    * Stock Volumes: We have calculated this in step 3. It should be assumed we are making each sample in consecutive order (in order of the dataframe index). The way we prepare these samples can vary, which is what were refer to as the *pipetteing strategy*.\n",
    "        * Pipetting Strategy 1: Add each stock to all wells then move onto next stock. The upside to this is the simplicity of the written protocol. It has a downside of using more tips, however parking the tip on the tiprack may resolve this (it is already being done when switching between pipettes). Also it can allow for evaporation or other time sensitve process to occur in the time between stock additions. **THIS IS CURRENTLY BEING USED DUE TO SIMPLICITY**. \n",
    "        * Pipetting Strategy 2: Adding all stocks to a well then moving on.  \n",
    "        \n",
    "* The way the OT2 protocols work can be read about here: https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/. Focus on the controlling with python sections. However generally this is the workflow (might add a graphic):\n",
    "    1. Initiate Protocol: A protocol object must be called and this is what is essentially the brains of the process. Each protcol object is unique and you must keep track of the one you are using, so feel free to name it anything. Protocols can either be called as a simualtion or a execution. This object will allow use to initialize all labware, instrumentation and commands to the OT2. \n",
    "    2. Initiate Labware: Using the protocol object, we can call labware objects and assign them a variable name and place on the OT2 deck. All that is needed is the protocol object, name of labware (which must exist in either the native or custom directory of labwares) and the slot number. \n",
    "        * The main use of the labware is to call a well as to use an argument in a command function. These well arguments are formatted as a string, knowing this allows us to concatanate more than two labwares (i.e. 2 96 well plates) into one list to making calling more easier without having to switch labware objects. \n",
    "    3. Initiate Pipettes: Using the protocol object, we can call instrument objects which behave similarly to labware objects. These pipettes have methods which are the OT2 commands.\n",
    "    4. Liquid Handling Commands: Move, Distribute, Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Currently this workflow is only split up between the initiation of the protocol/labware/pipette (***OT2Commands.loading_labware***) and the liquid handling command with the intializing step returning a dictionary with the appropiate object ready for liquid handling commands (***OT2Commands.pipette_stock_volumes***) once fed into another function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***OT2Commands.pipette_stock_volumes*** does something notable which you may want to follow in other protocols. It returns the well of every sample created in the order it was made in a list. This list is useful when populating information in the final dataframe meant for exporting and storage."
