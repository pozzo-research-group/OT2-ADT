    "* The first step to planning an experiment is to load the experiment variables and inputs from a csv file. Every variable should have an input with an acceptable datatype. At the moment this step is done by opening a CSV file in Excel, where the first column is the name of the variable and the adjacent column is the variable value. The default delimitter is (,). \n",
    "    * Reading directly as csv is fine but it requires you have correctly format strings. This forces you to put marks ('') around each string variable value when planning the experiment. NOTE: You still need to place marks around anything inside a dtype i.e components inside a list [\"component 1\", component 2\"]. However you do not need to place it around numbers or other dtypes.\n",
    "        * To remove this dependency we can build our own interpreters for our specfic cases such as to not use ast.literal_evals default unpacking.\n",
    "    * Loading from excel can be done in a similar manner but is avoided due not having xlrd or openpyxl depdenency native to python, and the opentrons being limited in the packages we can add/update. Hence we default to a CSV.\n",
    "* The experiment dictionary consist of keys being the variable name and the value being the variables value. It is important to always keep in mind the order of every variable is linear and should be assumed to be match all other variables (i.e. Component Shorthand Names index 1 = Component Concentration index 1). This assumption is the default for any function using variables from the experiment dictionary, however we can deviate it from it if needed. \n",

This case requires you to not only remove the components of interest in the volume side of the dataframe, but if the removed component is part of a stock which contains a common solvent, that removed quantity must find itself back to the common solvent. The upside to this case is there is no need to update the composition/concentration poriton of the dataframe as \n",

    "        * Pipetting Strategy 1: Add each stock to all wells then move onto next stock. The upside to this is the simplicity of the written protocol. It has a downside of using more tips, however parking the tip on the tiprack may resolve this (it is already being done when switching between pipettes). Also it can allow for evaporation or other time sensitve process to occur in the time between stock additions. **THIS IS CURRENTLY BEING USED DUE TO SIMPLICITY**. \n",

    "    1. Initiate Protocol: A protocol object must be called and this is what is essentially the brains of the process. Each protcol object is unique and you must keep track of the one you are using, so feel free to name it anything. Protocols can either be called as a simualtion or a execution. This object will allow use to initialize all labware, instrumentation and commands to the OT2. \n",
    "    2. Initiate Labware: Using the protocol object, we can call labware objects and assign them a variable name and place on the OT2 deck. All that is needed is the protocol object, name of labware (which must exist in either the native or custom directory of labwares) and the slot number. \n",
    "        * The main use of the labware is to call a well as to use an argument in a command function. These well arguments are formatted as a string, knowing this allows us to concatanate more than two labwares (i.e. 2 96 well plates) into one list to making calling more easier without having to switch labware objects. \n",
    "    3. Initiate Pipettes: Using the protocol object, we can call instrument objects which behave similarly to labware objects. These pipettes have methods which are the OT2 commands.\n",
    "    4. Liquid Handling Commands: Move, Distribute, Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Currently this workflow is only split up between the initiation of the protocol/labware/pipette (***OT2Commands.loading_labware***) and the liquid handling command with the intializing step returning a dictionary with the appropiate object ready for liquid handling commands (***OT2Commands.pipette_stock_volumes***) once fed into another function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***OT2Commands.pipette_stock_volumes*** does something notable which you may want to follow in other protocols. It returns the well of every sample created in the order it was made in a list. This list is useful when populating information in the final dataframe meant for exporting and storage."
